"""
Defines the SemantivaExecutor abstraction and a default synchronous implementation.
Executors encapsulate how individual pipeline tasks (node processing) are run,
decoupling the orchestration logic from the actual execution strategy.

This abstraction allows Semantiva to support multiple execution models:
  - Synchronous (SequentialSemantivaExecutor)
  - Thread- or process-based pools
  - Distributed task frameworks (Ray, Dask, Celery, etc.)

An executor's submit() returns a Future, enabling orchestrators to
track and compose asynchronous results uniformly.
