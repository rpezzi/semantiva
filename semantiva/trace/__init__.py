"""Semantiva tracing (SER v1).

This package provides the core tracing infrastructure for Semantiva pipelines
based on the Semantic Execution Record (SER). Each completed node emits a single
``SERRecord`` capturing the operation, dependencies, context_delta, assertions,
timing (wall and CPU) information, optional tags/summaries, and status.
Drivers implement the :class:`~semantiva.trace.model.TraceDriver` protocol to
persist these records.
